      Describe version control<br>
      Version control is a way to track changes, revisions, or edits to a file. Version control is like log book for a file- all changes made are logged and recorded. So when a user uses version control, the are able to flip through the log book and see all the changes and when they were made over time.

        Explain how git tracks changes<br>
        git tracks changes when a user pulls, commits, and merges changes from a local file (also called a repository, or "repo") in their computers to a master or origin file. It's a best practice principal to perform these actions on different "branches" or subfiles of a repo. When a user makes a change and wants to track it, they must pull and commit it. Then, if they would like to merge it to the master file, they must merge it.

      Evaluate the benefits of using GitHub to store code<br>
      GitHub is a great way to store code because it offers users a graphical view of files and an easy way to share code with others. It's also free!
