  <h2>What it's like to give and recieve performance feedback at DBC</h2>

No apology for that *genius* title.
</p>
<p>Pairing up with other DBC students for challenges helps me by pushing me to try new concepts, explain my thought process, and learn new things from my peers. When I'm working by myself, it's easy for me to get stuck when I feel I've exhausted all possible options and still can't solve something, however; when I'm working in a pair working, I don't feel like it's so impossible. Two heads better than one type of thing. Overall, I enjoy pairing. There's not one pair session I've had where I thought, "I'd rather be doing this alone." Pairing also helps me be less hard on myself. Sometimes after I read a super dense chapter in Well-Grounded Rubyist or run into a big challenge, I start feeling defeated. When pairing, I see my peers grapple with the same concept as me or botch something, and it give me hope haha It reminds me that we're both students and they're learning too!

I've reviewed feedback from pairing sessions, and I'm relieved, refreshed, and inspired by the comments! I think they were very honest, and I appreciated that my pair peers put thought into their words. I'm not surprised at the feedback, and I'm encouraged to step it up and be aware of my own patterns the next time I pair up. Although reading feedback was great, writing feedback was tough. Writing feedback was hard because I don't want to hurt feelings. But I know feedback I give is going to help my peers the most if it's constructive and honest. We have to know how we can improve before we get better. I appreciate honest in feedback because that's how I can get better. And I want to get better at this!
</p>

My next pairing session, I am going to be more confident when I have an idea or something to say. Having the confidence to experiment (and fail) is something I struggle with, but I know I can handle it better in the future. I struggle with it because I don't want to be wrong (I just want to be #1! haha), but ultimately the point is to learn as much as I can. I learn by trying, by asking, by saying, so I should do those things all the time - duh!
