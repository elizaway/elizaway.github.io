      This week at Dev Bootcamp, we've been learning how to use git and GitHub.com to share, copy, edit, and merge changes to files. It's been a steep learning curve, but I'm getting the hang of it. Here's what I think of it so far...
    <p>
      Version control is a way to track changes, revisions, or edits to a file. Version control is like log book for a file- all changes made are logged and recorded. So when a user uses version control, the are able to flip through the log book and see all the changes and when they were made over time.
    </p>
        git tracks changes when a user pulls, commits, and merges changes from a local file (also called a repository, or "repo") in their computers to a master or origin file. It's a best practice principal to perform these actions on different "branches" or subfiles of a repo. When a user makes a change and wants to track it, they must pull and commit it. Then, if they would like to merge it to the master file, they must merge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is a great way to store code because it offers users a graphical view of files and an easy way to share code with others. It's also free!
