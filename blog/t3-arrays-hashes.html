      Hi, reader! In this blog, I'm going to tell you a little about Arrays and Hashes in Ruby. At Dev Bootcamp, we've just begun our dive into Ruby last week, and we've already started experiementing using arrays and hashes. Arrays and hashes are similar objects - they are both containers for a variety of objects. These objects stored inside can be accessed with key. To access an object stored in an arrays, the key is an integer, whereas to access an object stored in a hash, the key can be anything, like a string, an integer, even an array. Because Ruby keys are not limited to integers, it's useful to to use hashes for certain types of data, such as names or titles.
    <p>
Both arrays and hashes are dynamic and can grow as needed to hold more new elements. Both can be built using literal and constructor initialization syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
     A neat shortcut trick to adding elements to an array is: <br>a = %w[ obj1 obj2 obj3 ] #=> [ "obj1", "obj2", "obj3" ]
<br>It's handy because typing out  all those "s and ,s can be a pain.
Hashes and arrays differ slightly in iteration practices: hashes are iterated by two values passed to blocks instead of one, like an array.
The value of a hash is that you don't have to index it with integers like you do with arrays. Which is useful because some data need to be associated with a specific label, not just a number.
