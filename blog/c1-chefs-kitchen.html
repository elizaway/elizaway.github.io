Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

I was struck by how Shereef brings home how different Dev BootCamp is from any other school that most students have ever attended. He stresses how many schools, web dev and other schools, offer a consumer approach: pay for tuition, get something because of it like a job. Shereef says that DBC is different because it sets student on a self-empowered journey of learning that will continue well beyond the 5 months of school. Students at DBC learn the technical skills of code but more importantly they learn how to create with code. It's not a passive learning experience.
Honestly, I feel like Shereef's expectations of DBC students is intimidating. Like right now, I'm late in publishing this blog entry. It's due tomorrow at 10AM and most students (I think) have already completed it. I'm doing the best I can to memorize and master the command line, but it's awful cryptic. GitHub is finally starting to make sense to me (praise the lord!), but I'm still slow with it. I'm not sure if I'm that ideal DBC student who is a creator and wearing an apron and holding a wrench rearing to go right now haha I WANT to be that student, and I hope I feel more like that student in the weeks to come.
I'm still charged up about being at DBC. I hope I'm going to learn loads more here than I could learn by myself. I hope I'm going to meet some amazing people who will inspire me. I hope I'm going to impress myself with how much I accomplish these next 5 months. <br>
Bring it on, DBC!
