<h1>Thoughtful Thoughts on Thinking, I Think...</h1>
<h2>What Concrete Random Thinking is All About</h2>

This Gregorc Thinking Style personal thinking style quiz has identified me as a "Concrete Random" thinker and secondly an "Abstract Random" thinker. While there are certain qualities listed for the CR thinking style that I consider to represent my personal thinking style, they aren't all encompassing of how I approach problem solving. CR thinking means:

</p>

<p>

This learner likes:

<ul>

<li>experimenting to find answers</li>

<li>risks</li>

<li>use their intuition</li>

<li>solving problems independently</li>

They learn best when:
<li>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
<li>able to compete with others</li>
<li>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</li>
What's hard for them?
<li>Restrictions and limitations </li>
<li>Formal reports </li>
<li>Routines </li>
<li>Re-doing anything once itâ€™s done </li>
<li>Keeping detailed records </li>
<li>Showing how they got an answer </li>
<li>Choosing only one answer</li>
<li>Having no options</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

I mostly agree that I am an experimental, independent learner who hates re-doing stuff and reporting how I did stuff. I think there are advantages and disadvantages to having this learning style as a DBC student. Experimenting with code has been a strength so far during my phase 0 experience because there's not always someone immediate to ask questions. Experimenting can help solve my own questions and, hopefully, lead me to the right answers! The independent aspects of phase 0 remote learning have been a little tough because it's hard to know how to reach out for help, but I've been using pairing sessions and the open office hours. Re-doing stuff, I fear, is a way of programming life. Refactoring seems like the name of the game here, which is frustrating for me sometimes. As I learned during that dbc video about refactoring, it's a slow process. And to me, as a CR learner, I feel like I've already done the hard stuff and I just want to be done! Def something I'm going to have to work on.

In terms of how I can see my learning style evolving, I think I can learn a lot from my peers at DBC who present vastly different learning styles. I've encountered times during pairing sessions where my partner explains or says something I simply wouldn't have considered on my own. Staying open to other's ideas and listening to peers will challenge me and make me a more well-rounded programmer!<br>
